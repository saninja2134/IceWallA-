# Pathfinding Algorithm for Grid-Based Maps

This Java project implements a pathfinding algorithm for grid-based maps, facilitating the efficient discovery of the shortest path from a start to a target position on the map. It utilizes the A* search algorithm along with components for map reading, player movement, and path reconstruction.

## Features

- **A* Search Algorithm:** Efficiently finds the shortest path on grid-based maps.
- **Map Reading:** Parses map data from files, extracting start and target positions.
- **Player Movement:** Handles player movement within map constraints, considering obstacles.
- **Path Reconstruction:** Reconstructs the shortest path found by the algorithm.

## Usage

1. **Clone Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saninja2134/IceWallA-.git
   ```

2. **Compile and Run:**
   ```bash
   cd IceWallA-/src/main/java/org/example
   javac Main.java
   java Main
   ```
